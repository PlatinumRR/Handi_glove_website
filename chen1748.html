								<h2>Week Two Report</h2>
							</header>
							<p>In this week, I worked on the functional specification with my team. We came across several problems under circumstances that we have not thought of before, especially the low time efficiency issue of the feedback module. I leaded the team to conduct experiment to test this problem. It turns out that the glove’s feedback is almost congruous with the feedback on human skin. The cooling effect can be perceived by user’s finger in less than 1 second whereas the heating takes around 2 seconds. This surely is sufficient enough. </p>

									<h2>Week Three Report</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
										
										Last week, I was responsible for conducting research on the characteristics of TTF-103 resistor. This is an important and indispensable step because the temperature changes have a great impact on the resistance and although TTF-103 resistor may look tiny, it’s resistance has to be precise enough to form a complete loop of the feedback control system. This can also facilitate us when doing circuit design.
										<br></br>
 										First, I conducted experiments on the TTF-103 resistor working under various scenarios. I built a table of temperature vs resistance to reflect the temperature impact on the resistance. A simple circuit consists of only the TTF-103 and the power supply were built to measure the resistance. The resistance was calculated by taking voltage value divided by the current value, which was both measured through DMM. The heating effect was created via placing the resistor into a glass of water and boiled it gradually, whereas the freezing effect was mimicked via placing the resistor in the refrigerator. It took me a quite a long time to monitor the resistance at the temperature of every 1 Celsius interval. I observed that as the temperature went up, the resistor value went down. The range of resistance is approximately between 100k ohms to 3k ohms.

										<br></br>
										Afterward, I also worked on the Peltier module to figure out the attributes for that module. The Peltier module is able to freeze or heat when flips the polarity of a power source. The module can also be attached to the fingertips of the glove to become part of the temperature feedback system. The table that I acquired below as well as the Peltier module attribute table can both help us build the circuit of temperature feedback system on the robot hand and user glove in the next week. 
										<br></br>
										One of our concerns as well as my goal of next week is that, since the transmitter—the temperature sensor and the receiver--the Peltier module does not coordinate with each other quite well and therefore there is a large discrepancy between the temperature transmitted by the sensor and the that received and displayed by the Peltier module, I need to delve in deep into this problem and figure out a way to ensure a complete and precise loop maybe by having a second layer of thermal-protective coating on the glove.

								<h2>Week Four Report</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								In this week, I mainly tested STM32 microcontroller board for our project. This particular board consists of a 32bit microcontroller , which is able to work with ultra low power consumption, while still has outstanding performance with energy-sensitive application. One particular feature of the board is its coin-cell socket, which is useful for evaluating the device’s performance in real battery-powered applications. When we first got the discovery board, we started to study the main components and the features. I and my teammates wrote a simple testing program with few lines of code to ensure that all the peripherals work as expected. Specifically, we first initialized the configuration registers and then after sending proper input signal, we displayed the output signal on the oscilloscope.

								<h2>Week Five Report</h2>
							</header>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/chassis.jpg" alt="" style="height: auto; max-width: 100%; object-fit: contain"/></span>
							<p>
								Last week, I began working on assembling the chassis of the robotic hand that had just arrived. 
We had a big discussion in the previous weeks upon choosing the robotic hand tool kit or 3D printing one by ourselves. In the end, we decided to get one from the market. The robotic hand chassis came as a box with all pieces separated. Although it might sound trivial, the assembly process actually takes up lots of time because there are many components involved with it such as the linear actuator and the PCB tray. These parts are crucial to the project as a whole. The biggest obstacle I’ve met was to align the tendons with the fingertips. It has to be in extreme precision in order to have them moved nimbly. Next week, we will be finishing off the assembly process by asserting the servo motor, the STM32 board as well as other electronic components into the arm.
