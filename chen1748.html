								<h2>Week Two Report</h2>
							</header>
							<p>In this week, I worked on the functional specification with my team. We came across several problems under circumstances that we have not thought of before, especially the low time efficiency issue of the feedback module. I leaded the team to conduct experiment to test this problem. It turns out that the glove’s feedback is almost congruous with the feedback on human skin. The cooling effect can be perceived by user’s finger in less than 1 second whereas the heating takes around 2 seconds. This surely is sufficient enough. </p>

									<h2>Week Three Report</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
										
										Last week, I was responsible for conducting research on the characteristics of TTF-103 resistor. This is an important and indispensable step because the temperature changes have a great impact on the resistance and although TTF-103 resistor may look tiny, it’s resistance has to be precise enough to form a complete loop of the feedback control system. This can also facilitate us when doing circuit design.
										<br></br>
 										First, I conducted experiments on the TTF-103 resistor working under various scenarios. I built a table of temperature vs resistance to reflect the temperature impact on the resistance. A simple circuit consists of only the TTF-103 and the power supply were built to measure the resistance. The resistance was calculated by taking voltage value divided by the current value, which was both measured through DMM. The heating effect was created via placing the resistor into a glass of water and boiled it gradually, whereas the freezing effect was mimicked via placing the resistor in the refrigerator. It took me a quite a long time to monitor the resistance at the temperature of every 1 Celsius interval. I observed that as the temperature went up, the resistor value went down. The range of resistance is approximately between 100k ohms to 3k ohms.

										<br></br>
										Afterward, I also worked on the Peltier module to figure out the attributes for that module. The Peltier module is able to freeze or heat when flips the polarity of a power source. The module can also be attached to the fingertips of the glove to become part of the temperature feedback system. The table that I acquired below as well as the Peltier module attribute table can both help us build the circuit of temperature feedback system on the robot hand and user glove in the next week. 
										<br></br>
										One of our concerns as well as my goal of next week is that, since the transmitter—the temperature sensor and the receiver--the Peltier module does not coordinate with each other quite well and therefore there is a large discrepancy between the temperature transmitted by the sensor and the that received and displayed by the Peltier module, I need to delve in deep into this problem and figure out a way to ensure a complete and precise loop maybe by having a second layer of thermal-protective coating on the glove.

								<h2>Week Four Report</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								In this week, I mainly tested STM32 microcontroller board for our project. This particular board consists of a 32bit microcontroller , which is able to work with ultra low power consumption, while still has outstanding performance with energy-sensitive application. One particular feature of the board is its coin-cell socket, which is useful for evaluating the device’s performance in real battery-powered applications. When we first got the discovery board, we started to study the main components and the features. I and my teammates wrote a simple testing program with few lines of code to ensure that all the peripherals work as expected. Specifically, we first initialized the configuration registers and then after sending proper input signal, we displayed the output signal on the oscilloscope.

								<h2>Week Five Report</h2>

							<span class="image left"><img src="images/chassis.jpg" alt="" width="80", height="300"/></span>
							<p>
								Last week, I began working on assembling the chassis of the robotic hand that had just arrived. 
We had a big discussion in the previous weeks upon choosing the robotic hand tool kit or 3D printing one by ourselves. In the end, we decided to get one from the market. The robotic hand chassis came as a box with all pieces separated. Although it might sound trivial, the assembly process actually takes up lots of time because there are many components involved with it such as the linear actuator and the PCB tray. These parts are crucial to the project as a whole. The biggest obstacle I’ve met was to align the tendons with the fingertips. It has to be in extreme precision in order to have them moved nimbly. Next week, we will be finishing off the assembly process by asserting the servo motor, the STM32 board as well as other electronic components into the arm.

								<h2>Week Six Report</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								This week, I finished drawing the PCB footpoint layout and started to write the code for analog to digital converter (ADC) module for the temperature feedback system. To achieve the temperature feedback, the temperature sensor value will be transferred to the robotic arm microcontroller via ADC. Then the microcontroller will be responsible for calculating the amount of voltage for the Peltier Module. After the calculation is done, the value will be sent as a communication packet to the other microcontroller on the glove. Upon receiving the packet, the software program will output a certain voltage value for the Peltier Module to generate appropriate heating or cooling effects. Here is my code for the ADC module that was used to implement the temperature feedback. Till now, we are still in the process of testing the temperature feedback code.
								<br></br>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/adc_code.png" alt="" width="80", height="300"/></span>
								Goals for next week:
My teammates and I will continue to write the STM32 ADC module's code and try to connect the microcontroller with our real Peltier Module sensor.

								<h2>Week Seven Report</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								This week I began working on the temperature sampling module. The goal of this module is to sample the temperature perceived by the robotic hand, which will be later on sent to the glove to complete the feedback system. In particular, I worked with Jiaen on the ADC configuration since both our tasks utilize this part. Afterward, I tested the ADC logic with the potentiometer where I sampled the voltage output(analog) by the potentiometer and then verify converted digital value on the debugger. In addition, I also associated the research I have done about the temperature sensor, for example, the range of the output with the program. 
								<br></br>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/controlmotor.png" alt="" width="40", height="300"/></span>
								Goals for next week:
								Since the temperature sampling module is almost done, my goal for next week will be refining the current program by building a thorough test suite of various temperature intervals and more importantly the temperature reproducing module, where to use PWM module to mimic the temperature perceived by the robotic hand on the glove. This is also a major component of the robotic hand-glove feedback system.

								Last week, I began working on the communication module. I first proposed to implement the SPI protocol but then realized that UART is a more straightforward approach. I first tested a few HAL functions including transmitting and receiving in both blocking and non-blocking fashion. Although there is no much difference in my small experiment, the online research online stated that interrupt-driven approach can have higher efficiency in a large project, especially the one like us where lots of synchronizations are involved. I tested the UART with FT232 and PC. With the baud rate and other configuration set up correctly, the board can communicate with PC without error.
                                                                <br></br>

                                                                Goals for next week:
								The goal for next week is trying to have two boards communicate with each other.<br></br>

                                                                Last week, I mainly contributed to use UART communication module to transmit and receive data with two different board. At first, I set up two separate boards to transmit the ADC signal from transmitter board to receiver board and then confirm on the computer that both sides have transmitted and received correctly via the buffer status. Then, I twisted the knob on the potentiometer to produce ADC  value ranges from 0 to 4000.  The transmitter then sends the real-time ADC value to the receiver on the other board to finish the communication process. I also resolved the library conflict issue of the STM32L1 driver that previously disallowed me installing on school computer system. After that, now I can monitor transmitter and receiver activities on two separate computers. Below is a code snippet of the UART transmitter and receiver and testing photos.<br></br>
                                                                Goals for next week:
                                                        	Use two communication boards to control servo.</p>

								Last week, I began working on using two communication modules to control pressure sensor and I also started to do the temperature feedback module. Although I have finished using the UART module to control pressure sensor, we still need to combine the motion restrain feedback module with the force feedback module. Therefore, we spliced the work where Jia En decided to improve the force feedback module and I mainly focus on temperature feedback module. At first, I followed the tutorial for the temperature module found on the official website to configure the peripherals. After that, I used the ADC to perform analog-to-digital conversions of the internal reference voltage and of the temperature sensor voltage driven by DMA. 
                                                                Goals for next week:
                                                                focus on the temperature feedback module</p>

								Last week, I mainly did the temperature feedback part for the project. I created a function which can transfer the ADC value to the real temperature value. Although there exist some error with real temperature value with the calculated one, we can adjust the number in the temperature function to close the real one. I can read the temperature value in the buffer right now. Here are the room temperature value and the temperature of warm water. 

                                                                Goals for next week:
								In the next week, I want to use UART to communicate the more cooling module value with the temperature sensor value. And try to do the test on our real glove equipment.
