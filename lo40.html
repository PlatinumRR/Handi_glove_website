								<h2>Week Two Report</h2>
							</header>
							<p>This week as our team looked at the functional description of our project, we came across multiple problems and constraints that we have not considered before. For example, a safety threshold that was thought of this week is something that was not considered before. The safety threshold refers to two different mechanisms. One is the temperature threshold that dictates the limit of the temperature response felt by the user. The temperature must be contained within a safe limit that can be placed against human skin. The other threshold refers to the maximum force that the glove can hold before it breaks. The problem now, however, is that we have yet to come up with a way to measure, detect, or predict the maximum force applied before the glove’s exoskeleton breaks. 
	I also researched more applications that pertains to the use of our device that promotes safety within the industry and research environment in order to further support the goal of our project.

									<h2>Week Three Report</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/RFP602.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										This week, I began working on 2 of the important components of our project—the Peltier Cooler and the pressure sensor. The Peltier Cooler module will be attached to the user’s glove. The specific location of attachment as well as the number of modules that will be used in our project has yet to be determined. It was discussed in week 3’s lab that instead of using 5 modules on all the fingertips, it is possible to substitute that method with using only 1 module on the palm of the hand. The reason for this proposal is that we may run into the problem of not having enough number of ADCs on our microcontroller. In addition, the glove may become very bulky which takes away from the user experience.
										<br></br><br></br>
										One of the concerns with the module that will be used in our project is the reaction time that the module will use. We investigated whether the change in heat will be rapid enough for the human skin to notice. The results of our investigation are that the cooling effect takes approximately 1 second to notice and the heating effect takes approximately 2 seconds to notice. Although the reaction times seems to be very slow (it was proposed by Prof. Mithuna that it should be kept around 0.5 seconds), in reality, a change that takes 2 seconds to notice actually feels almost instantaneous to the human skin.
										<br></br>
										The pressure sensor will be attached to the fingertips of the robotic hands. I researched the approximate maximum amount of force that our robotic hand will be expected to come across and decided that 300g is an appropriate value. I got this number from holding a can of coke (340g) [1] on my fingertip. It is difficult to hold this much weight for a long time, from my personal past experiences, this felt like a greater force than what my fingers will typically come across. The pressure vs. resistance values are also plotted in graph 1.

								<h2>Week Four Report</h2>
							</header>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/System diagram.jpg" alt="" /><ul>System Block Diagram</ul></span>
							<p>
								This week, I worked on looking at the overall function of our project. Interestingly, I was asked in my interview this week to draw the block diagram for our project. Specifically, I am looking at the part that connects the Peltier modules to the microcontroller as well as the connection between the microcontroller and the linear actuator.
								<br>
								Two weeks ago, during the talk during lab with the TAs and the professor, the question of how we counter the problem of not having enough ADCs to implement 5 peltier modules on our robotic hand. One suggestion was to install just 1 module on the palm, instead of 1 on each fingertip. During my interview, I discussed with my interviewer that using a multiplexer and just one ADC to control all 5 modules would be more feasible.
								<br>
								In addition, I looked at the connection in between the linear actuator and the microcontroller. There should be a FET in between these 2 connections in order to control the power delivered to the linear actuator.

								<h2>Week Five Report</h2>
							</header>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/9-21-2018p1.png" alt="" /><ul>Arduino Code</ul></span>
							<p>
								This week, we began working on the assembly of our robotic arm. We purchased a robotic arm from the market instead of constructing our own in order to save a big portion of our time. We connected our robotic arm to an Arduino to test the potentiometer controls that dictate the finger movements. We experienced a lot of problems with instability—particularly in the twitching motion made by the fingers at the end of its movement limits. When the finger extends near the limit and contracts near the limit, it will twitch. We changed our code numerous times considering that it might be our read value that is causing this instability. In the end, we ended up fixing the problem by using better wires.  
								<br>
								Lessons learned
								<br>
								I learned that the debugging process could take a long time even for very trivial issues. Next time, instead of being so fixated on what’s at hand, I should step back and look at the big picture to see if the issue could potentially be elsewhere.
								<br>
								Goals for next week
								<br>
								Next week, my goal is to start on the communication between the temperature sensors and the Peltier cooling modules. Ideally, I would result in being able to have the sensors detect temperatures accurately and convey the signal to the cooling modules.

								<h2>Week Six Report</h2>
							</header>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/lo_a.png" alt="" /><ul>Schematics</ul></span>
							<p>
								This week, I started learning to use Eagle to begin construction of our PCB design. I have never used Eagle before and also have not designed any PCBs, so there was a lot of learning for me to do. I began by completing the footprint, symbol, device, and application circuit for our DC motor driver. I am continuing to create these for other devices utilized in our project, for example, the other voltage regulators and the Peltier coolers.
								<br>
								Goals for next week
								<br>
								Since I will not be on campus next week, I will continue to work on PCB design remotely

								<h2>Week Seven Report</h2>
							</header>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/Schematics.png" alt="" /><ul>Schematics</ul></span>
							<p>
								This week, I continued to work on our schematic for the PCB's. I utilized Eagle to draw the schematics while referencing the datasheets. The schematics are important for the project in terms of our hardware progress. I learned that there are a lot of components in a schematic that must be customized based on the specific used of the device. In order to determine the specified rating of various RCL components, caluclations need to be done. The next steps after this is to continue on working on the overall PCB design that will be sent for printing.
