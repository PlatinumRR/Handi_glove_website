								<h2>Week Two Report</h2>
							</header>
							<p>This week as our team looked at the functional description of our project, we came across multiple problems and constraints that we have not considered before. For example, a safety threshold that was thought of this week is something that was not considered before. The safety threshold refers to two different mechanisms. One is the temperature threshold that dictates the limit of the temperature response felt by the user. The temperature must be contained within a safe limit that can be placed against human skin. The other threshold refers to the maximum force that the glove can hold before it breaks. The problem now, however, is that we have yet to come up with a way to measure, detect, or predict the maximum force applied before the gloveâ€™s exoskeleton breaks. 
	I also researched more applications that pertains to the use of our device that promotes safety within the industry and research environment in order to further support the goal of our project.
