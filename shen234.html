								<h2>Week Two Report</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								This week our team finished functional description of our project. Since different parts are written by different individual members, I leaded the team to revise the description to ensure the consistency throughout the report. Jia-En and I discussed the solution to offset the expansion and contraction of air inside the air pressure system in order to provide accurate touch feedback under different temperature. Besides, I also conduct the experiment to test the cooling and heating delay of our Peltier cooler. In the experiment I found the delay is acceptable only when user have a direct contact with the cooler. Therefore, a substitute solution need to be found if a thermal silica separation layer is needed between user’s skin and Peltier.

Tension string may act as a force buffer to reduce the risk of structure failure.

								<h2>Week Three Report</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
									This week, one of our main goals is working on our BOM.
									<br>
									In order to find proper drivers for our linear actuator and Peltier cooler, I tested their power consumptions: For the actuator, under 12V DC, the steady current is around 0.5A with the starting peak around 1A; for the cooler, it draws steady 3.3A of current under 0.8V DC.

									After Jia-En's research on the microcontroller, I looked into the STM32 family. Since our project will be ADC intensive, our main concern is to have enough ADC channels on a single microcontroller. Among all the available microcontrollers in Digikey, STM32L1 subfamily provides the most number of ADC channels (40x12b)[1]. Thanks to Rohan for providing us with valuable suggestions in selecting the appropriate micro.
									<br><br>
									Last but not least, we planned to implement a closed loop control on the touch feedback system by placing another touch sensor between the user's finger and airbag; however, with discussion, we think it is hard to counter the pressure shift caused by temperature change, and it increases the mechanical difficulty. Instead of using film pressure sensor, placing an air pressure sensor inside the syringe might be a more robust solution for precise touch feedback control. The microcontroller can easily monitor the pressure inside the airbag and make changes accordingly.

								<h2>Week Four Report</h2>
							</header>
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/SYD_img/breakout.jpg" alt="" /><ul>Breakout Board for STM32L151ZET6</ul></span>
								<p>
									This week, we set up the environment for programming the STM32 microcontrollers with STM32CubeMX and SystemWorkBench. We are going to use the STM32L152CDISCOVERY board as the hardware environment and the onboard ST-Link as the programming tool to develop our project. Although we already got the example code for STM32L1 family, a lot works still need to be done for fully-understanding the controls of the system.
									<br>
									Hardware side: I finished the breakout board for our STM32L151ZET6 microcontroller, and it will be sent to fabrication next week. The breakout board will be a handy tool to test other system circuits as well as the inter-system communication in our project.
									<br>
									Last but not least, I uploaded all the project files onto the GitHub. These project files include the EAGLE files, libraries, and the Eclipse projects. This way, our team can synchronize our work anytime on different platforms.

								<h2>Week Five Report</h2>
							</header>
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/SYD_img/fingertip_holder.png" alt="" /><ul>holder design</ul></span>
								<p>
										This week we were working on the robotic hand. We encountered with a power line issue that the resistance on the power line is too high that the fluctuation of current consumption causes a lot of unacceptable noise appears on the power line. Since our design will have a large power consumption, it will be important to have a good power line design: Low power line resistance, good connector contact, decoupling capacitors for ICs and starting capacitors for servos and DC motors.
										<br>
										Also, I designed a compact sensor and cooler holder for our control glove. An aluminum heat sink will be attached to Peltier cooler to dissipate heat, a heat isolation will be placed between the airbag and the heat sink to minimize the thermal expansion and contraction of the air inside the airbag system.
										<br>
										Next week, we will focusing on the controlling algorithms and the PCB design.

								This week I finished part of the circuit for our project.
								<br>
								For the 12V to 3.3V regulator, I chose a switching regulator for our design. with the consideration of heat and efficiency. 
								<br>
								Serval calculations need to be performed in the circuit design. The EN pin has a typical turn-on voltage of 1.25V with the upper limit as 6V. Two resistors (150k and 51k) are used to set the EN voltage as VIN*51/(150+51).  Therefore, the acceptable input range is from 5V to 16V (12V in our design).
								<br>
								Another two resistors are connected to VSNS pin to set the output voltage.<img src="images/SYD_img/3v3_vsns.png" alt="" style="width:210px;height:100px;"/> where the Vref = 0.8V, in our case, 3.3V output is needed and so by the calculation R5=15k, R6=4.7k.
								<br>
								L1=100uH is determined by <img src="images/SYD_img/3v3_l.png" alt="" style="width:300px;height:60px;"/>, where Iout is 0.1A and K is set to be 0.3 to give an average result.
								<br>
								On the PCB side, thermal vias are placed on the bottom of the regulator pad. Top and bottom are covered with GND plane to give a better thermal and noise shielding performance. The pin header connectors have the symmetric design and can be reversely connected.
